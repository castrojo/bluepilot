# SCP Configuration Example
#
# Upload ISO files using SCP (SSH Copy Protocol).
# This is similar to SFTP but uses the SCP protocol directly.
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Ensure you have SSH access to your target server
# 2. Generate an SSH key pair if you haven't already
# 3. Add the public key to your server's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# 4. Set the following GitHub secrets in your repository:
#    - SCP_HOST: Your server hostname or IP address
#    - SCP_USER: Your SSH username
#    - SCP_SSH_KEY: Your private SSH key (entire contents)
#    - SCP_PORT: SSH port (default: 22)
#    - SCP_PATH: Remote path to upload files (e.g., /var/www/isos)
#
# Note: SCP is simpler but less feature-rich than SFTP

[scp]
type = sftp
# Server details - use GitHub secrets
host = ${SCP_HOST}
user = ${SCP_USER}
port = ${SCP_PORT:-22}
# Authentication - use key-based auth
key_pem = ${SCP_SSH_KEY}
# SCP-specific settings
# Use SCP protocol instead of SFTP
use_scp = true
