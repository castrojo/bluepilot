# AWS S3 Configuration Example
#
# Amazon S3 is a highly reliable object storage service.
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Create an AWS account
# 2. Create an S3 bucket in your desired region
# 3. Create an IAM user with S3 access permissions
# 4. Generate access keys for the IAM user
# 5. Set the following GitHub secrets in your repository:
#    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Your AWS Access Key ID
#    - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Your AWS Secret Access Key
#    - AWS_REGION: Your bucket region (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1)
#    - AWS_BUCKET_NAME: Your S3 bucket name
#
# Note: S3 charges for both storage and egress bandwidth

[aws-s3]
