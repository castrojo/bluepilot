# Setup Instructions:

# 2. Create a B2 bucket in the Backblaze dashboard
# 3. Create an Application Key with read/write access to your bucket
# 4. Note your Application Key ID and Application Key
# 5. Set the following GitHub secrets in your repository:
#    - B2_ACCOUNT_ID: Your Backblaze Account ID (also called Application Key ID)

type = b2
# Account credentials - use GitHub secrets
